# Version History

| Version | Changes |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Version 1.6.0** | **NEW FEATURES**<br>- **Loot Actor Exports:** Added new layouts so you can export "Loot" actors which were introduced into RMU in v1.1.44 to support the Item Piles module integration.<br><br>**UNDER THE HOOD**<br>- **Foundry ApplicationV2 Support**: Upgraded the export button injection to natively support Foundry's modern AppV2 sheets.<br>- **Scalable Architecture**: Rebuilt the data-extraction pipeline with defensive parsing. The module is now highly resistant to missing data and future-proofed for any new actor types the system might introduce.|
| **Version 1.5.1** | **BUG FIXES**<br>- Fixed to prevent module trying to export a sheet for actor types other than characters or creatures.|
| **Version 1.5.0** | **NEW FEATURES**<br>- **Added Movement Section**: Added a more detailed movement section that shows the standard pace multipliers, AP costs for moving as an action and pace penalties for moving while acting.<br>- **Added Import from HTML**: You can re-import the embedded "character capsule" onto an existing actor you own from the sidebar (right-click context menu). This will completely replace all information with the data stored in the capsule.<br><br>**IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- **New Spanish translations**: New es.json file provided by community member, GusRPG. Thank you!|
| **Version 1.4.0** | **NEW FEATURES**<br>- **Added Portraits** Added the option to include the character's portrait. Technically, this converts the image into Base64 code and includes it in the output HTML file so will increase the file size of the HTML file by the size of the image plus ~30%.<br>- **Added a General Information section** A new section has been added that can include the general information about the character or creature (e.g., appearance, identity or biographical information).<br>- **Granular Detail Toggles**: Portrait, General Information (height, weight, age, etc) and Biography/Description (Long text) are now separate options. You can include the stats without printing pages of backstory.<br><br>**UNDER THE HUD**<br>**Character Capsule**:<br>- **Embedded Raw Data:** The exported HTML file now silently contains a copy of your character's **Raw Foundry Data** (JSON). *Why?* This turns your HTML export into a self-contained backup. In a future update, I plan to allow re-importing characters directly from these HTML files.<br>- **Important Note on Editing:** The HTML file is a **visual display** of the data, not the data itself. If you edit the text in the HTML file it **will not** change the embedded backup data. *Think of it like a printed receipt:* Scribbling a new price on a receipt changes what you see on the paper, but it doesn't change what the bank actually charged you. Any future "Import" feature will read the hidden, unedited data block, *not* the visible text you see on the screen.<br><br>**BUG FIXES**<br>- **Token Requirement:** Added a warning if you try to export an actor that does not have a token on the current scene. (Foundry requires a token to exist to correctly calculate derived stats like Attacks and Spells).<br>- Fixed a missing css style bug that was causing some UI elements to appear transparent.|
| **Version 1.3.0** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- **Metric Support:** Supports display of metric distances and weights.|
| **Version 1.2.0** | **NEW FEATURES**<br>- **Fully customisable exports:** You can now select your preferred layout and style separately, and turn each section on or off.<br><br>**NEW TEMPLATES/STYLES:**<br>- A **printer-friendly** style that uses less ink.<br>- A **dark mode** style.<br><br>**BUG FIXES**<br>- Fixed some missing localisation text in the templates.|
| **Version 1.1.1** | **BUG FIXES**<br>- Fixed leaking css that was forcing the Foundry settings to always show in the sidebar.|
| **Version 1.1.0** | **NEW FEATURES**<br>- **Creature Sheet support:** You can now export creature sheets as well as character sheets.<br>- **Export Preview**: See the layout and style of the sheet export in a preview window before downloading.<br>- **Multiple export templates:** You can now select from different export templates.<br>- **New Template:** Added a new Compact Template designed to look like a stat block for including in adventures, and a Fun Template for, well, fun!<br><br>**IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- **Localisation:** Added support for the exported character sheet to be localised using the current selected language set in FoundryVTT (if supported by both the RMU system and this module).<br>- Empty Skill Categories are now hidden when the sheet only shows ranked/favourite skills.|
| **Version 1.0.0** | **IMPROVEMENTS**<br>- Styled export dialogue.<br>- Replaced font awesome icons with Material Design Icons.<br><br>**BUG FIXES**<br>- Removed hardcoded "+" from resistance bonuses.|
| **Version 1.0.0-beta1** | **INITIAL RELEASE** Make sure to read the README.md first (I know you won't...you won't even be reading this).|
